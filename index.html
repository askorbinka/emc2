        <h2>About the app</h2>
        <p>E=M*C^2 is an app which allow you to plan your time, produce experiments to increase your efficiency and to track your results, 
          find best working strategies and log them as your personal data.</p>
        <p>The work of the app starts when you create a plan: choose its type - for now (any 
          period of the day or night, just a quick checklist), for a day (daily planning), week, month and other periods of time, 
          what lets you to create not only tactical but also strategic planning.</p>
        <p>Next thing - after creating the plan, you can work with the app in two modes: be online and use special tools for time count and track
        your work to do and done (you should press the button "done"). While you make a plan, you can write an estimate time, which the app will use to count how many things you can do 
        in definite period of time, so you could write a number of reserved hours for different tasks and rely on the app. It will tell you
        if your estimate was exaggerated and you have no time for other things + it will suggest you to prioretize your tasks to do the most important things.
        And all that just on the fly, you won't give it more than 5 minutes drinking tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second mode is much simpler - you just create plan and it works just like a checklist - no reminds, no time counter etc., but you can still log your time.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a special department in the data grid for urgent unplanned tasks, which will be count too.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the process of counting your productivity is this: the app looks at the difference between your estimation and logged time (or the tasks finalized and left unfinished + your logged time) and 
          forms the stats for you, including:
          <ul>
            <li>difference in time = error coefficient</li>
            <li>difference in planed volume of work and fact volume = max amount of tasks per different periods according to their difficuty (5-grade scale)</li>
            <li>difference in amount of planned and unplanned tasks = time loss coefficient and con</li>
            <li>tendency of your time spending</li>
            <li>tendency of your productivity</li>
            <li>and some other...</li>
          </ul>
          The app will not only generate the stats for you, but also let you to make some analysis of it: evaluate your productivity, time, errors, all that stuff. These data won't be used for computing, it's just for you 
          to take seriously your time and life.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the system generates yout stats, you can enable the auto-tips: when creating a new plan the app will limit the amount of tasks and time accroding to the general stats tend. So it will suggest you 
          the best working strategy.
